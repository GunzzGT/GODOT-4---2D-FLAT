# GODOT4-2DFLAT
 Godot basic tutorial
 <br />
 Actually rather than tutorial its more of my training montage, also dont forget that "<br / >" is enter for .md files
 
 This would be my basic program structure for 2D flat game, not entirely sure if "flat" is the right word here. Basically you control the character to move forward-backward and turn left or right. There is no up or down control in this game and the character is viewed from the top (above pointing downwards) from the character. Also yes, there is no jumping here.
